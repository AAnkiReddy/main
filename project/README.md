# Project

Teams of students will complete a final project that applies some ideas from the class. Teams can consist of at most three students. Here are some guidelines:

- Your project shall be hosted on github. If you are on a team, pick one member's account.
- Add a link to your project's github repository [here](https://github.com/iit-cs579/main/wiki/Project-Teams)
- Add a descriptive README.md at the root of your project.
- You may use off-the-shelf analysis tools in your work; no need to start from scratch.
- [Here](http://curtis.ml.cmu.edu/w/courses/index.php/Social_Media_Analysis_10-802_in_Fall_2012#Sample_Projects) are some projects from a CMU course that are good examples to help you come up with ideas.
- You **must** collect your own data for this project. You can get ideas of the types of data [here](https://github.com/aronwc/mlsm/wiki/Data).

The 200 points is broken down into:
- 10 points - **Proposal**: Is the proposal presentation clear, well-organized, and thorough?
  -  The proposal should be a 7 minute presentation (with 3-5 minutes for questions)
  -  A clear problem statement
  -  A clear hypothesis
  -  An overview of the method
  -  Specifics about the data you intend to use (how many, from where, with what attributes?)
  -  Description of how your project is similar to and different from related work
  -  A timeline for the remaining work. For teams, indicate who will do what.
-  40 points - **Presentation**: Is the presentation clear, well-organized, and thorough?
-  50 points - **Code**: Can I reproduce your results by running your code? Is the code well-written, debugged, and documented?
-  50 points - **Report**: Follow the similar format as the papers we read for class. Your report should be 5-6 pages, including all references and figures. Are the main algorithms, hypotheses, and assumptions clearly stated? Are the comparisons with related work sound? Sections include:
  - *Introduction*: What did you do and **why**? What are the research questions of your analysis? What is your hypothesis?
  - *Data*: What data did you collect and how?
  - *Methods*: What did you do with the data, precisely?
  - *Experiments*: These should answer your research questions and test your hypotheses.
  - *Related work*: How have others approached this problem? What makes your approach different?
  - *Conclusions and Future Work*: What should we have learned from reading your paper? What's left to do?
- 50 points - **Scientific rigor**: Are your claims supported by the experimental results? Have you attempted to rule out all other reasonable competing hypotheses? Are the experiments soundly developed and executed?
